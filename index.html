         <h2>K-12 </h2>
            <p>I had the opportunity to try many sports growing up, but running, cycling and swimming, were never any of those sports. I participated in the following sports in my adolescence: 
               <ul>
                  <li>gymnastics</li>
                  <li>dance</li>
                  <li>soccer</li> 
                  <li>softball</li> 
                  <li>basketball</li> 
                  <li>volleyball</li>
               </ul>

         <h2>College</h2>
            <p>I went to college at Missouri State University in Springfield Missouri. I had two cousins who lived in Springfield and motivated me to run. My cousin Aaron would come to my dorm room my freshman year, pick me up, and take me out on runs. I remember my first 5K race, the Kitchen Run, I could not run the entire 5K without stopping. We began doing 5K's frequently to keep me motivated. I don't know that GPS watches existed back then, I used a Nike Plus pod on my shoe that synced with my iPod mini to record my distance and pace. I can remember the first time I ran a 10K in training, I was with my cousin Aaron and my friend Lauren, I didn't have a watch to look down at to see how far I had gone, so I had no idea how far we had ran. My cousin tricked me and before I knew it, he hollered out, YOU JUST RAN 10K!!!!!</p>

         <h2>Post College</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I kept up running after college and my cousin Anna convinced me to sign up for my first Half marathon after I graduated from Grad School. I remember running on the treadmill at the gym over lunch to get in miles, and ran the Inaugural Phoenix Half Marathon in 2011, with a time of 2 Hours 17 minutes as my first Half Marathon. I wasn't sure what would be next but knew I wanted to improve and keep running!</p>

         <h2>Recent Years</h2>
            <h3>2016</h3>
               <p>This is the year I got married and it was a turning point to life as I know it. Long story short, I was struggling with chronic abdominal pain. I would joke with my best friend Jessica that I had an ulcer and she'd been planting the seed that she wanted me to run a marathon with her, I told her I would once I got the tummy pain figured out. After a couple months of pain, doctors telling me nothing was wrong, I ended up in the ER with Pancreatitis, shriveled up Gall Bladder full of black sludge and stones, and gastritis. I had surgery the following morning on Thanksgiving to remove my gall bladder, and was hopeful that would heal the pancreas and the pain would go away. Fast forward a couple months, the pain persisted. After many more doctor's appointments, tests, and persistence on my part, I got my Celiac Disease diagnosis. I went cold turkey on Gluten and never turned back. Within a couple weeks the pain was GONE, and I felt better than ever! </p>
            <h3>2017-2018</h3>
               <p>So here we are, the cronic pain gone, so I had to own up to my promise to run a Marathon with my best friend. Each time my long runs increased, it was a new milestone of the longest distance I had ever ran. We had a great time putting in the training miles. I ran my First Marathon in 2017, the Twin Cities Marathon in Minneapolis, Minnesota. My dream goal was to finish under 4 hours (a 9:08 pace), and I finished in 3:57!!!! This was the start of my Marathon running journey.</p>
            <h3>2019-2021</h3>
               <p>At the beginning of 2019 I hit a goal I never dreamed I would hit, I ran sub 1:40 (7:40 pace) at the 3M Half Marathon in Austin, Texas which achieved the qualifying time standard to join the <a href = "http://kansascitysmoke.org/theteam/megan-albin/">Kansas City Smoke</a>! The last mile of this race I kept checking my watch and I knew I had it if I didn't let up, I was overjoyed!!!! 2020 was a tough year with the start of the pandemic, I had trained so hard for a Spring 2020 marathon, and it was cancelled 19 days before race day. I kept grinding and achieved another bucket list goal of running a Boston Qualifying (BQ) Marathon time at the Brookings Marathon in South Dakota in September 2020. Only small marathons were taking place in 2020, this race had 118 finishers, it was a lonely marathon running mostly alone for 26.2 miles, but I felt on top of the world at the finish. In 2021 I took a break from marathon running and focused on triathlon. I far exceeded my expectations at IRONMAN Augusta 70.3, falling just 60 seconds short from making it on the podium for my age group. I now have a fire in me to qualify for the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships! </p>
